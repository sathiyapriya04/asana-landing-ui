## About the Project

I recreated the Asana landing page layout from the given Figma file using React. The design is broken down into reusable components, and care was taken to keep the layout clean and responsive across different screen sizes.

This project is meant to demonstrate frontend development skills rather than backend functionality.

- JavaScript (ES6+)
